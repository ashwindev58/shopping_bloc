# Shopping Bloc

## Overview

Welcome to Shopping Bloc, a demonstration shopping app developed using Flutter. This app serves as an educational resource for learning Flutter Bloc state management. We leverage the power of Flutter Bloc to build a robust and scalable application architecture.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this app is to provide a hands-on experience with Flutter Bloc state management. By exploring the codebase and understanding the implementation of Flutter Bloc, developers can gain valuable insights into building maintainable and efficient Flutter applications.

## Features

- **Flutter Bloc State Management:** The app is built using the Flutter Bloc library for state management. Flutter Bloc helps in organizing and managing the application's state, leading to a more structured and maintainable codebase.

- **Fake API Data:** To simulate real-world scenarios, we utilize data from a public fake API. This allows developers to understand how to integrate external data sources into a Flutter app and manage asynchronous operations.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally and explore the code:

1. Clone the repository:
